# ðŸ“¦ `pymupdf` (fitz)

## âœ… What is PyMuPDF?

**PyMuPDF**, also imported as `fitz`, is a Python library that allows you to **read, edit, and extract content from PDF documents and other file formats** (like EPUB, XPS, and CBZ).

It is known for being **fast, lightweight**, and capable of **high-quality PDF processing**, including extracting text, images, metadata, and annotations â€” all with just a few lines of code.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Extract text from PDFs (by page, region, or full doc)
- Extract and save images from PDF pages
- Edit PDF content: highlight text, add annotations, draw shapes
- Merge, split, or crop PDF files
- Access PDF metadata (author, title, creation date)
- Search text within documents with positional data
- Supports both text-based and scanned (image-based) PDFs

## ðŸ“˜ Example: PyMuPDF in Action

Suppose you want to extract the text from the first page of a PDF:

1. Import the library: `import fitz` (PyMuPDF)
2. Open the file: `doc = fitz.open("file.pdf")`
3. Access the first page: `page = doc[0]`
4. Extract text: `text = page.get_text()`

You can then print or save the extracted text for further processing. Similarly, you can extract images using `page.get_images()` and manipulate annotations with ease.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This in Practice

To use PyMuPDF in your project:

- Install it using: `pip install pymupdf`
- Import it as: `import fitz`
- Open a document: `doc = fitz.open("yourfile.pdf")`
- Loop through pages: `for page in doc: ...`
- Use functions like:
  - `page.get_text()` â€“ for text extraction
  - `page.get_images()` â€“ for embedded image data
  - `page.insert_text()` or `page.draw_rect()` â€“ to annotate or modify

You can also save the modified PDF using `doc.save("updated_file.pdf")`.

## ðŸ“Š What Kind of Results Can It Produce?

Using PyMuPDF, you can generate:

- Text summaries from academic papers
- Image datasets from scanned PDFs
- Annotated PDF reports with highlights and notes
- Searchable logs of content from legal or financial documents
- Cropped or cleaned PDF files for print/export

For example, from a 20-page research paper, you can extract only the abstract and figures, or highlight key findings programmatically.

## ðŸ§  Summary

**PyMuPDF** is a highly capable tool for handling PDF files with Python. Itâ€™s ideal for developers working on **document processing, content extraction, or annotation systems**.

Whether you need to automate PDF reading, extract visual data, or edit existing documents â€” PyMuPDF gives you all the tools in a single, efficient package.
