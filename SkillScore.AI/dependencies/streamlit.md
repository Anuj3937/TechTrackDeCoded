## âœ… What is Streamlit?

**Streamlit** is an open-source Python library that helps you build interactive web applications quickly using only Python. It eliminates the need to learn frontend languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, making it ideal for data scientists, students, and developers who want to transform their Python scripts into beautiful, usable web apps.

Streamlit apps are reactive â€” they automatically update in real-time whenever users interact with the application or when the script changes. This makes it highly suitable for rapid prototyping, dashboards, and educational tools.
